# Resources

This directory contains supporting material used during the SIM registration backdoor investigation.  
All files in this folder are **read–only reference artifacts**; none of them are required to run any code from this repository.

## Contents

- **Slides & Reports**  
  High-level summaries, presentation decks and narrative reports that explain the case, the ecosystem and the systemic risks in human-readable form.

- **Diagrams & Images**  
  Additional diagrams (beyond those in `flows/`) that show architecture, data flows, and stakeholder relationships in the SIM registration system.

- **Reference Notes**  
  Extracts from analysis notes, checklists and research references that informed the investigation, with all sensitive identifiers anonymised.

## Purpose

The resources in this folder are intended to:

- Give readers more context around how the case unfolded.  
- Document assumptions, threat models and regulatory background.  
- Provide material that can be reused in training, briefings, or internal audits.

None of the documents here contain active credentials, live endpoints, or exploit instructions.  
Where original documents contained such information, it has been removed or replaced with neutral placeholders.
